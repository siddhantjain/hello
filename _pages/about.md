Hello!

I am a software engineer specialising in computer vision. Specifically, I enjoy working on problems around 3D computer vision and engineering them into products that can be used at scale.

For my educational and professional background check out my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bluenotebook/)

I sometimes write about (mostly technical) things on this [blog](https://siddhantjain.github.io/year-archive/).

I am always happy to meet and/or collaborate with new people. Please feel free to reach out via [email](mailto:post.siddhant@gmail.com)
